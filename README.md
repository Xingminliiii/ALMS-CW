# Machine Learning Project Setup

## Installation

To ensure that you have the correct versions of libraries needed for this project, a `requirements.txt` file has been created. Please install the dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Code

After installing the required libraries, you can run the code by typing the following command in your terminal:

`python main.py` 


## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn

Please verify that these libraries are installed by checking the `requirements.txt` file.

## Execution Time Note

Running `main.py` may take around 40 minutes due to the time required for model training.

### For Quick Testing

If you want to check if the code executes without performing full training, consider reducing the number of epochs for Task B to 2 or 3.

## Dataset Information

The `PneumoniaMNIST` and `PathMNIST` datasets have been pre-split into training, validation, and testing sets, so there is no need for additional dataset splitting.
